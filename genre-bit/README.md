Project Name: GenreBit

Outline goals:
	(a) We may be using public datasets from Kaggle or Tensorflow
	(b) Our main goal is to determine the genre/mood of a song based on key characteristics 
	(c) Unsupervised k-means clustering is the algorithm we will attempt to implement first
	(d) We will test accuracy by requesting input from the user, taking accumulated accuracy over time
