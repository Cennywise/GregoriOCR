## **Project: Corpus of Chords**
***

1. How data will be collected:
    * We're using a dataset of Bach chorales hosted on Github (link below) in MIDI note numbers.   
    * [Bach Chorales](https://github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset).
2. Task:
    * Generate note sequences that match musical conventions from the dataset.
        * Generate a language model using a traditional natural language method called skipgram.
        * Possible extensions can include clustering and applying clusters to max likelihood.
3. Learning algortihm:
    * Skipgram.
    * Possible clustering and max likelihood.
4. Measure Performance:
    * How accurately the algorithm predicts the next chord.
    * We will listen to it and see if it sounds decent. (:
