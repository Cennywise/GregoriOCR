<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Name of Project: Content-based Movie Recommendation System
How will the data be collected?
We access this data directly from Kaggle. This dataset was generated from The Movie Database API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

## What task do you want to accomplish with the data?
We want to build a movie recommendation system based on genre, keywords, user rating etc.
of the movies, and with a given input, we can give an output that contains the top ten most similar movies.

<!-- Q2 -->
## What kind of learning algorithm do you propose using to accomplish this task?
We will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select key features. Then we will employ a neural network and use the key features as hidden layers to train our neural network. We will use content-based filtering to train the data and make predictions. 

<!-- Q3 -->
## How will you measure your performance of the task? 
Train a dataset to learn. Based on the training result give a suggestion of the next similar movie a user might want to watch. Performance will be measured by the accuracy of the suggestion.
